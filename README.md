**Regex Usage for Data Extraction and Cleaning**




##Purpose


Regex was applied to clean and standardize multiple columns of the CSV dataset. The main use cases for Regex in this project were:




Address Standardization: Cleaning postal codes and addresses to ensure they follow a consistent format.
Data Validation: Ensuring that specific fields (such as postal codes, energy scores, and GHG emissions) contain valid values.
Data Transformation: Extracting meaningful parts of certain fields or transforming them into more usable formats.
